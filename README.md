# Davest Solutions
Quantitave trading firm with a focus on stock recommendation through algorithmic trading strategies, backtested and automated through the means of machine learning.
The problem it solves:
Big size hedge funds/High-frequency trading firms are known for hiding the details of how they work, neglecting the trasparency between investment and operations management, resulting into issues like impoper audits and internal conflicts which makes for a profit only for the organization itself. They are going to keep making money and violating the basic rights to information.
We, on the other hand, are building a transparent financial platform using quantitative research models(advanced mathematics oriented, Machine Learning based future prediction); people should know how their money is being managed in order to build trust in the customer base. 
In place of huge capital money, we are going to let the customer be as flexible as possible.
The best time to invest has always been yesterday. Let's change that and bring ease and safety into trading backed by solid mathematical analysis.
